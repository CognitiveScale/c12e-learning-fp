Data constructor for an Non Empty List happens to be named …

- Companion Objet has same name as type
- when you search for implicit … it will search for companion object of type as well

append is associative

equals is transitive (), reflexive (a = a), symmetry (a = b, b = a)

one on syntactic, one on symantic 
commutation is about derivation
if you have formula that looks like this … you can derive a formula that looks like this … 

its healthy not to compare two things - no real valid equals

type class - codifying some set of operations which ideally are lawful

.. good type class:
- very extensible across broad data types - if not, put method on data type
- can derive a whole bunch of methods based on type class operators … can now make a dumb data type … just data
- instances for free … limited amount of implicit .. infinite amount of derived instances (automatic derivation of type class instances … all instances of all the nesting with 1 law)
	- semigroup of tuple lets us have semigroup of tuple of tuple of 	tuple of tuple … of tuple of tuples

monoids can append … 
if you have something thats foldable and append able, now you can sum … 

without FP, a lot of this stuff breaks in soo many weird ways
- correctness is preserved across modular bounds


- everything you can do with pattern match you can do with fold
if you have fold, you don’t need pattern match, now you can make  stuff private … leads to abstract data type - from old comp legacy w / binary data
- don’t know how type is implemented, all you have is functions that take in and spit out…

- Algebraic - Can see cons, can see internals.
- Abstract - Cant see internal, just have interface

- Programmers revoke right to use pattern match - maybe use it on subset of matches - restrict usage
- Abstraction of data representation (encapsulation)

- Algebraic is about what you can do when you are not about encapsulation

Stuff to implement it: Disjunction, validation, Nel

Abstract data type - implemented all different kinds of ways - 


[1, 2, 3]

[1,2,3].fold(10000000000000000000)(sum)
sum(1, [2, 3].fold(10000000000000000000)(sum))
sum(1, sum(2, [3].fold(10000000000000000000)(sum)))
sum(1, sum(2, sum(3, [].fold(10000000000000000000)(sum))))
sum(1, sum(2, sum(3, 10000000000000000000))))


Gang of 4 book, visitor pattern
Hard to do something right - probably on axis where oo doesn’t do things nice

fold - one step closer to visitor pattern
if no first order functions - need interface

two functions are isomorphic- go back and forth between function …
when you break up a tuple, you are currying it..

Uncurry, when you lump all together args 

view bounds?

var - lets you mutate variable
