- entropy through heat
- block until nature can generate a random number
- entropy generator in production
	- code will use sudo randomness
	- little entropy to get seed, and get seed for random generator


- beware - lots of controversial notes are being taken :p


abstraction for something thats foldable - called foldable in haskell, has no type classes / no laws

mathematicians can easily abstract stuff, but intrinsically, the signatures for fold can be drastically different.

Bob Martin - makes living talking about OO principles - solid - single responsibility, …, interface segregation, …
> Keep interfaces small, if done, higher chance of being able to sue interface on more data structures!

Somethings may be semigroups but not monodies
Monoids - 

prove evidence in tests … or in head…
semigroup - take two things that are the same an lump them together…
associativity - a + b + c … = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
which end of a list doesn’t matter, only appending in the same order matters ….

scalaz - lots of it comes from abstract algebra …
for all a 		identity					zero
> 	+				x + a = a	(x=0)		x + a = x ()
> 	*				x * a = a	(x=1)		x * a = x (0)
>   max     max(x, a) = a			max(x, a) = x
						(x = minvalue)    (x = maxvalue)    

max value is not infinity - integers not behave intergery…

scalaz name is wrong

sometimes people call the identity a zero …
in scalaz, identity is called zero for mooned - sometimes called empty, or mempty

0 used in context of a monoid, name is flipped…

first monoid was addition, whose identity was 0, thus naming screwed.



We could have made monoid extend semigroup, 
happen a lot mathematically, 
can implement it well in scalaz

Alwan - we want to get rid of sub typing in scalaz 8

scalaz has this state of the art sub typing
how does compiler get right instance at right time … i found a semigroup and a monoid, which one do you want…

involves sub typing, control the stack of implicit, fix the order of resolution of methods

… so these things have overlap, but its difficult to get right, 
ignore this complexity for now

Use a monoid with a list, 
can’t use monoid with a non-empty list - its never empty!

Reader
ReaderT - T means monad transformer…
kliesly - 
	a -> M[B]

getting applicative instance for kliesly of a validation
	can do given validation has a semigroup instance
	if you are on the error side, definitely have error
similar to a disjunction

might have something to bring, might not have something to print
	can **accommodate for emptiness in a monoid** ….


semi ring - has identity but not zero?
		+ and * , multiply has to have an inverse with zero divisibility exception
