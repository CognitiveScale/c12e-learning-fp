Semigroup code in CogScale style
- scala 2.10 - implicit classes
	generates not only class, but corresponding implicit method to convert datatype to that class

keyword called implicit class
	can make a class implicit 

class that gives method
	implicit method that lifts to raw type

implicit has to be on something - put it on trait, and mix it into objects

… or import it because of companion object

implicit 
	- typeclass encoding
	- type enrichment
		- (extension methods) 
		- 


static dispatch
	- compile puts functionality into object at compile time
	- know whats going to happen when you are compiling
  - type classes are all about this

dynamic dispatch	
	- function runtime object has functionality
	- pattern matching - dynamic - don’t know what pattern you are going to get


JS has weird type cohesion problems
Related to auto boxing?
	no, not necessarily, auto boxing stays in same ballpark

Java tries to keep it at a reasonable type?

lookup Weird boxing gotchas

“we are doing casting with these ops”
want to add new method on type
only type we don’t have access to
using it for a pinpoint reason


Odersky hates making new keywords,
	- reuses same keywords 
	- macros are coming … until then, use implicit
	- strong dif b/w scala and similar langs


On data structure only implement rudimentary functions
Get functions for free with library…
Scalaz is giant lib built on type classes

If there are domain ideas, may not want to release domain representation to users, can hide by placing case classes in companion object and making them private, 

if they are not private, people can pattern match on them

implicit function - type coersion
implicit in scope - grab it for type parameter block

optimize implicit search by first figuring out what you can transform to, then if you can, find out what functions you have …

funny name for library that implicit first came out in
inferences / type enrichment

put stuff on type class instance for type we don’t own

in fp, we worry about compiler speed

bare companion object for typeclasses
on companion types of data types - type class methods


do need the value if you are going to enrich it …

type classes are enrichment to type

implicit functions - compiler can’t randomly generate stuff, args have to be implicit as well….

with implicit, we only want there to be only one instance …
it must be a statement of fact …
universally true

global uniqueness on some data types like int
	 - had to wrap int, had to specialize it - max in, min int, …

typeclass instances
same answer regardless of parenthesizing

still need to write laws of type class instances.

can write the laws and make sure the laws are testable
