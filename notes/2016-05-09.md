can implement fold left with fold right
coding style - call args with (), funcitons with {}


implmeneint foldleft with fold right - stil blow stack
how do we get around this?

- use a mutable data structureâ€¦ run elemetns through mutable ds until we are done


implement fold left in terms of fold right - bit tricky
fold left written in terms of a mutable data structure

test frame work - not just property based tests - can write simple tests

speclite - ripped it to make spec base class - can re-make it more like spec lite

3 ways to write fold left
1. wiht reverse
2. with fold right
3. with mutable data structure so we dont blow stack


can do fold right in terms of fold left, but it will still blow stack

implement reverse
see if i can get applicative in the right polarity
