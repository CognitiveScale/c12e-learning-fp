Question: 
Data Constructors - 24 and 25

Type of Data Consturctors Construct -> IList

List - type or type constructor?
Constructor - takes an argument and returns thing it constructs

IList -> takes a type
- Some people might call IList a type (not a real type, takes an A)
- others might call it a **type constructor** 

Calling it a type, not the worst thing…

… the “kind” of a type
- language feature turned on by default by using the plunging
- turned off features so people stop asking questions
- compiler might tell you to turn feature on
- Martin Odersky - author of Scala

Type class of another type class
- Typeclass1[TypeClass2[type, typeclass3[type2]]] ?


IList could be of something that takes a type parameter or doesn’t

[1,2,3].fold(0)(_ + _) 

this match{ 
	ICons(1, 
		ICons(2, 
			IConss(3, 
				Nil)
			)	
		)
	)
}

		cons

a					cons

			b					cons	

						c				cons
										
									d				nil

nil -> 
cons _> 

Folding will replace the nil with a default value, and a cons with a function that takes two args

[(1) + ([2,3].fold(0)(_ + _) )]
[(1) + ((2, [3].fold(0)(_ + _) ) )]
[(1) + ((2, (3 + [].fold(0)(_ + _) ) ) )]
[(1) + ((2, (3 + 0) ) )]

Fold is structure preserving

Can do in any language
Now we think of a data structure in terms of an abstract syntax tree

FP is about referential transparency
Side effects
Exception throwing 
Infinite recursion is a special case

Compiler won’t let you call a value and do nothing with it - except for Unit type

Brian Meccana - has good checks for code

When you extend App -> you get a main method

App is builtin - comes in std lib
stuff inside braces -> becomes delayed initializer
